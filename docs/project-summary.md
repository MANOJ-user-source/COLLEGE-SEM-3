# Interactive 3D College Website - Project Summary

## Project Overview
An interactive 3D website showcasing all 7 Semester-3 college subjects with dynamic, engaging visualizations and user interactions. The website will be deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access and portfolio presentation.

## Project Goals
- Create an immersive 3D web experience for academic content
- Showcase technical skills in modern web development and 3D graphics
- Build a portfolio-ready project demonstrating creativity and technical proficiency
- Deploy a live, publicly accessible website via GitHub Pages

## Target Subjects (7 Total)
1. **Operating Systems (OS)**
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
3. **Computer Networks (CN)**
4. **Mathematics for AI (MATHS AI)**
5. **Web Design & Programming (WDP)**
6. **Version Control (VC)**
7. **Digital Transformation & Innovation (DTI)**

## Key Features
- **3D Interactive Homepage**: Navigate between subjects using 3D objects
- **Dynamic Animations**: Smooth transitions and engaging visual effects
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Subject Pages**: Dedicated interactive page for each subject
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, intuitive interface with 3D elements
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast loading times despite 3D graphics

## Technology Approach
- Modern JavaScript framework (React/Vite)
- 3D graphics library (Three.js or React Three Fiber)
- Responsive design with modern CSS
- Version control with Git
- Deployment via GitHub Pages

## Timeline (Estimated)
- **Phase 1**: Documentation & Setup (Current)
- **Phase 2**: Project Initialization (1-2 days)
- **Phase 3**: Core Structure Development (2-3 days)
- **Phase 4**: 3D Interactive Features (3-4 days)
- **Phase 5**: Content Integration (2-3 days)
- **Phase 6**: GitHub & Deployment (1 day)
- **Phase 7**: Polish & Testing (1-2 days)

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-15 days (can vary based on complexity)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 7 subjects have dedicated interactive pages
- [ ] 3D navigation system is functional and intuitive
- [ ] Website is responsive across all devices
- [ ] Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Smooth performance (60fps for 3D animations)
- [ ] Professional, portfolio-quality presentation

## Repository & Deployment
- **Repository Name**: TBD (e.g., `sem3-interactive-website`)
- **GitHub Pages URL**: `username.github.io/repository-name`
- **Version Control**: Git with regular commits documenting progress

## Notes
- This project serves both as a practical web development exercise and a portfolio piece
- Demonstrates proficiency in modern web technologies, 3D graphics, and deployment
- Can be expanded in the future with additional features or content
